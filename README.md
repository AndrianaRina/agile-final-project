Final project for the IBM Agile Development course on Coursera. Includes Kanban board, issue template, and burndown chart.

## Overview
This project demonstrates Agile practices through the creation of a Kanban board, user stories, acceptance criteria, and a burndown chart to visualize progress across the sprint.

## Structure

- **Labels:** Stories labeled according to their backlog stage (Product, Sprint, In Progress, Done).
- **Estimates:** Story points assigned to each story.
- **Sprint:** Created with a descriptive title and linked to all active stories.
- **Burndown Chart:** Visual representation of sprint progress.
